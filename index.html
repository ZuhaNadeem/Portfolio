        <h2>Final Year Project - Multi-Factor Crop Yield Optimization Toolkit</h2>
        <p>In this project, a novel approach to crop yield optimization is presented, focusing on the development of a toolkit capable of finding global optima without the need for mathematical or functional representations of the underlying data or problem. Traditional optimization methods often require explicit mathematical models, which can be challenging to derive for complex agricultural systems. The proposed toolkit employs multi-factor Bayesian optimization, different machine learning models to achieve its goal. The toolkit is designed to handle agricultural systems' inherent uncertainty and nonlinearity, offering a versatile and efficient solution for farmers and agronomists. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the toolkit in optimizing crop yields, showcasing its potential to revolutionize agricultural practices. This project contributes to the field of agricultural optimization by providing a robust and adaptable toolkit that can significantly enhance crop yield predictions and management strategies, ultimately leading to improved agricultural sustainability and food security.</p>
